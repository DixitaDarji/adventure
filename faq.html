		<h4>1. How many people can join a tour?</h4>
		<p>We keep our group sizes low so you have the freedom to move around and get involved with your surroundings, as well as more personal attention from our local guides. This intimate size ensures that your group will not crowd your experience. You can expect up to 15 travelers on a trip but the average is 10. Check individual trip pages for maximum group sizes.</p>
		<h4>2. What clothing should I pack for one of your adventures?</h4>
		<p>We always recommend packing as light as possible however the specific requirements for your tour will vary widely depending on where and when you are traveling. Our 'Trip Details' document includes a suggested packing list and these can be downloaded from each individual trip summary page. The checklist is tour specific and based upon the experience of our ground staff.</p>
		<h4>3. Can you help arrange my travel visas?</h4>
		<p>Requirements for travel visas vary widely depending on your nationality and your destination. Although we are unable to arrange visas on your behalf we have provided links on our “Resources” page to websites that will help you determine if visas are required. If you do require a visa you can arrange them yourself or use the services of a travel agent or visa processing company.</p>
		<h4>4. What vaccinations are recommended for this adventure?</h4>
		<p>It's important that you receive the most accurate and up-to-date travel health information for the region you will be visiting. The only one qualified to provide you with this advice is your family physician or a specialist from a Travel Health clinic. Our “Resources” page does provide links to a number of websites that contain excellent background information related to travel health issues. Nevertheless these websites are no substitute for a personal consultation with a qualified medical professional.</p>
		<h4>5. Do your tours include international airfare?</h4>
		<p>Travelers arrive from all over the world to begin our tours and it is not possible to include international airfare in our prices. We would be happy to help you arrange flights. Just ask for an air quote when making your booking.</p>
		<h4>6. What are the age restrictions on your tours?</h4>
		<p>To travel independently you must be at least 18 years of age. There are no upper age limits for most of our tours (although 18-to-Thirtysomethings tours are restricted exclusively to 18-to-39-year-olds). Also, travellers with pre-existing medical conditions are required to complete a medical questionnaire. Our Family Adventures are open to families with children aged between 6 and 17 years of age. Our standard (non-family) adventures are open to children aged 12 years or older when accompanied by a parent (max. two children per adult). The two-children-per-adult restriction does not apply to our Family adventures.</p>
		<h4>7. I'm a single traveller, will I be charged a single supplement?</h4>
		<p>Most of our trips do not have a single supplement. This means that the accommodation is on a twin share basis and, if you are travelling on your own, you will be sharing a room with another G Adventures traveller of the same sex. Some tours have an optional single supplement or rarely a mandatory single supplement.

An optional service that may be available is called "My Own Room". This service allows solo travellers to request their own private room while on tour. The cost and the details vary by trip, so please refer to each trip summary page for details.</p>
